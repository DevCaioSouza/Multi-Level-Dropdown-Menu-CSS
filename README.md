Hi. This is a Multi-Level Dropdown Menu made using only basic HTML and CSS, without the need of any JS or CSS library, such as jQuery or font awesome.<br>
I think this one is very much worth trying out doing it for practice or to use it on your webpage, it's very functional and also looks pretty good.<br>
Cheers!!
